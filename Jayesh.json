☃️ Hi guys.

Added AeroInsta Settings 》 Verified account 》 Custom blue tick URL address option with AeroInsta V20.0.0. With this option, you can define your own blue tick (verified badge) URL for AeroInsta and share this URL with your friends. The Instagram accounts you specify will be blue tick (verifed badge) for anyone using your URL.

How can I generate a URL?

1️⃣ Register on Github by clicking here.

2️⃣ After registration, create a new project by clicking here:



After typing the name of your project (you can write whatever you want), click the green button named "Create repository".

3️⃣ Click the "creating a new file" button on the next screen.



4️⃣ Enter a name that ends with ".json". I have named "tikler.json" as an example.

In the large space just below, write the usernames you want the blue tick (verified badge) to appear, such as ["bozkurt.hazarr","bozkurt.hazarr","bozkurt.hazarr","bozkurt.hazarr","bozkurt.hazarr"]
